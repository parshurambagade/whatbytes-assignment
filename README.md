# Product Listing App

This is a basic product listing app built as part of **Whatbytes Frontend Assignment**. It's an ecommerce-like application where users can browse products, view details, and more.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **React** - Frontend library

## Current Status

This is my first commit after setting up the project structure. I've:

- Created the Next.js app with TypeScript
- Added Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up the basic folder structure for organizing components, services, stores, etc.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.
